scalene-vector
==============

A fast 2D and 3D vector library in Scala suited for game development.  It offers mutable and immutable versions of 2D and 3D vectors.

The code is messy and is not intended for public consumption yet, but you might find it useful if you don't mind cleaning it up and refactoring it to your own purposes.
